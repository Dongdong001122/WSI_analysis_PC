Analysis on WSI and the drving factors
We selected the entire DNC as our study area. The DNC is located from 32.16°N–41.83°N to 95.88°E–119.08°E, and it covers an area of approximately 752,443 km2, which is 7.83% of China's land area. The annual temperature ranges from −4°C to 14 °C and average annual precipitation varies from 250 to 550 mm(F. Wang, Ge, Yu, Wang, & Xu, 2017). The mean annual potential evaporation varies from 800 mm to 1800 mm generally exceeds the mean annual precipitation, and the peak is 3000 mm(Resources, 2022). Grassland and cropland are the dominant land uses/land covers in the DNC, with grassland accounting for approximately 47.6% of the entire region and the cropland accounting for nearly 27.5%. In the end of 2019, the population living in the DNC was approximately 0.16 billion and accounted for 11.4% of China's total population(Council, 2021). In 2018, the total GDP of the basin is 19.4 trillion yuan and accounted for 21.55% of China’s total GDP. The whole basin is divided into 446 catchments according to the Global Drainage Basin Database (GDBD)(Masutomi, Inui, Takahashi, & Matsuoka, 2007).

In order to get the stress index of water resource in Yellow River Basin, the WSI algorithm was used. And with the aim of analysing the factor driver of the changes, Moran's Index (including global and local) and PLSR(Partial Least Regressin Index) was used.
